## About Me

Hello! I'm a business development professional with a strong foundation in international marketing, currently expanding my skill set into the dynamic fields of data analytics and programming.

My background in international marketing has equipped me with:

* **Global Perspective:** Experience in navigating diverse markets, understanding cultural nuances, and developing effective international strategies.
* **Communication & Relationship Building:** Proven ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders from various backgrounds and build strong, lasting relationships.  For example, I successfully managed key accounts in the APAC region, resulting in a 20% increase in year-over-year revenue.
* **Strategic Thinking:** A knack for identifying opportunities, analyzing market trends, and developing strategic plans to achieve business objectives.

Driven by a passion for leveraging data to drive informed decisions, I am actively pursuing knowledge and skills in:

* **Data Analytics:** Exploring data analysis techniques, statistical modeling, and data visualization to extract meaningful insights from data.
* **Programming:** Learning programming languages (e.g., Python, R) to automate tasks, manipulate data, and build analytical solutions.

I am excited to combine my business acumen with my growing technical skills to contribute to innovative projects and drive impactful results.

**Currently Learning:**

* Python for Data Analysis (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
* SQL for Database Management
* Tableau for Data Visualization

**Let's Connect!**

I'm always open to connecting with fellow professionals, learning about new opportunities, and collaborating on interesting projects. Feel free to reach out!
